# Ray Tracing Assignment - Graphics 4-1

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive ray tracing application developed for a computer graphics course assignment. It features a custom-built ray tracer with OpenGL-based real-time visualization, supporting a variety of geometric primitives, advanced lighting, and texture mapping. The project is implemented in C++ and is designed to load scenes from a text file, render them using ray tracing techniques, and provide interactive camera controls for scene exploration.

## Key Features

- **Scene Loading from File**: Reads scene descriptions from `scene.txt`, supporting spheres, triangles, and general quadric surfaces. The scene file also specifies lighting and floor parameters.
- **Ray Tracing Engine**: Implements recursive ray tracing with support for Phong illumination, shadows, and reflections. The recursion level is configurable via the scene file.
- **Geometric Primitives**:
  - **Spheres**: Defined by center, radius, color, material coefficients, and shininess.
  - **Triangles**: Defined by three vertices, color, material coefficients, and shininess.
  - **General Quadrics**: Supports arbitrary quadric surfaces (e.g., ellipsoids, paraboloids, cubes) with clipping and material properties.
  - **Floor**: An infinite floor along the XY-plane, rendered with either a checkerboard pattern or a texture.
- **Lighting**:
  - **Point Lights**: Multiple colored point light sources can be defined in the scene.
  - **Spotlights**: Supports spotlights with position, direction, color, and cutoff angle.
- **Texture Mapping**:
  - The floor can be rendered with a checkerboard pattern or a loaded texture (BMP, PNG, JPG, TGA, etc.).
  - Texture can be toggled at runtime; texture coordinates are mapped from world coordinates.
  - Texture repeats for enhanced detail.
- **OpenGL Visualization**:
  - Real-time rendering of scene geometry and lights using OpenGL/GLUT.
  - Interactive camera system with movement and rotation controls.
  - Option to toggle coordinate axes display.
- **User Controls**:
  - Arrow keys: Move camera forward/back/left/right
  - Page Up/Down: Move camera up/down
  - 1/2: Rotate look-at point left/right
  - 3/4: Rotate camera up/down
  - 5/6: Tilt camera
  - w/s: Move camera up/down
  - 0: Capture ray-traced image
  - t/T: Toggle floor texture (checkerboard/texture)
  - a: Toggle coordinate axes
  - ESC: Exit
- **Image Output**:
  - Captures and saves ray-traced images as BMP files.

## File Structure
- `2005090_Main.cpp`: Main application file. Handles OpenGL setup, scene loading, camera controls, and the main rendering loop.
- `2005090_Header.hpp`: Contains class definitions for objects (Sphere, Triangle, GeneralQuadric, Floor), lights, and utility functions for ray tracing.
- `bitmap_image.hpp`: Header-only BMP image library for reading/writing images.
- `scene.txt`: Scene description file specifying objects, lights, and rendering parameters.
- `stb_image.h`: Image loading library for texture support.
- `demo.exe`: Compiled executable (Windows).
- `Output_*.bmp`: Example output images generated by the ray tracer.
- `sample_texture.bmp`, `sample_texture2.bmp`, `texture1.bmp`, `texture2.bmp`: Example texture images for the floor.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How It Works
1. **Scene Loading**: On startup, the program reads `scene.txt` to load objects, lights, and floor parameters.
2. **OpenGL Initialization**: Sets up the OpenGL context and window for real-time visualization.
3. **Camera Controls**: Users can move and rotate the camera to explore the scene interactively.
4. **Ray Tracing**: When triggered (e.g., by pressing '0'), the program performs ray tracing to render the scene with lighting, shadows, reflections, and textures, saving the result as a BMP image.
5. **Texture Mapping**: Users can toggle between checkerboard and texture-mapped floor at runtime.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (tested on Windows)
- OpenGL and GLUT libraries
- No external dependencies beyond provided headers (`bitmap_image.hpp`, `stb_image.h`)

## Usage
1. Build the project using a C++ compiler with OpenGL and GLUT support.
2. Place `scene.txt` and any texture images in the executable directory.
3. Run the executable. Use the keyboard controls to explore the scene and capture images.

## Credits
- Developed as part of a university graphics course assignment.
- Uses `bitmap_image.hpp` for BMP image handling and `stb_image.h` for texture loading.

### Ray Tracing Assignment - Graphics 4
This repository contains the code for a ray tracing assignment in a graphics course. The assignment involves implementing a ray tracer that can render scenes with various geometric shapes, materials, and lighting effects.
To run the codes, use the following command:
     
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o demo.exe -lfreeglut -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lglu32; start demo.exe
```


```bash
g++ 2005090.cpp -o demo.exe -lfreeglut -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lglu32; start demo.exe
```
